# Homework 1: Code Refragmentation

**Version 1.0.0**

## Description

For homework 1, it was my responsibility to check the code first for accessability features through either proper syntax or use or alt tags following image sources. I was also checking to make sure the website is fully functional.

I started by replacing many of the unsemantic code with semantic code. The href links at the top of the page were placed into <nav> tags. The content to the right of the page was contained within <aside> tags as well.

To help with accessability through screen readers, <alt> tags were placed behind each image source to provide better descriptions of what is on the page.

Also, class names were cleaned up as a few had the same effect on elements of the website.

Lastly, I checked for functionality. I found theat the "Search Engine Optimization" button in the navbar was nonresponsive. This was solved by inserting the missing class into the section it was meant to link with.
